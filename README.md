
### A static site builder for collections of geoJSON map indexes

Map-o-Matic is a static site theme designed to make interactive [map indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_map) sharable online without too much hassle. 


## Basic building blocks:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs)
- [Turf JS](https://turfjs.org/)

## Heavily inspired by:
- [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/)
- [OpenIndexMaps](https://openindexmaps.org/) 

## Thanks to:
- [EvanLovely's csv_to_jekyll](https://github.com/EvanLovely/csv_to_jekyll)
- [June-Skeeter's mapbox-for-openindexmaps](https://github.com/ubc-lib-geo/mapbox-for-openindexmaps).
