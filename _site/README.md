Map-o-Matic is a static site theme designed to make interactive [map indexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_map) sharable online without too much hassle. 


# Basic building blocks
The main components of this project include:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/)
- [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs)

...And heavily inspired by:
- [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/)
- [OpenIndexMaps](https://openindexmaps.org/)
